# blipt
**blipt** is a fast, disposable scratchpad for your terminal. It's a tool designed to let you quickly jot down, copy, and clear lists of ideas, todos, or notes — without the need for saving files manually. Every session lives in memory, and a markdown-based history is saved automatically in your current folder.
> No clutter. No pressure. Just type and toss.
